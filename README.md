# STRAP
STRAP(Structural Analyis Program) is a GUI bases program developed using C\# for structural analysis application. The program is developed mainly to analyze small-scale 2D structures like beam, truss and plane frames. It uses the matrix method to solve for the member forces. The analysis procedure is very interactive and provide graphical data input with friendly academic terminologies. The codes for this program was written during the 3rd-year of my undergraduate study.
